# FaceAttend

FaceAttend is a facial recognition–based attendance system designed for classrooms. Instead of spending several minutes calling names or having students sign sheets, students can log their attendance as they enter or leave the classroom.

## Why FaceAttend?

The idea for FaceAttend came from a personal frustration. After every class, I had to wait around 5 minutes while attendance was taken. That inefficiency gave me the idea to create a tool that could save time.

## How It Works

FaceAttend leverages **OpenCV**, a powerful computer vision library, to detect and recognize student faces. Once a student’s face is identified, the system records their attendance automatically. All recognized faces are matched against a database that students or the instructor can easily update as students join or leave the course.
